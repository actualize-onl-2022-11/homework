# HTML Themes

Creating all your own custom CSS styling and JavaScript can take hours. To make your a project look professional without being a designer, you can use a theme! 

We're going to practice installing with a free theme.


### Exercise

Pick a theme from [free css templates](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates) or [html5up](https://html5up.net/). Then, use the Theme Install with Vue.js CLI Cheat Sheet to install it in your `movie-vue-app`. 

After you successfully install it, pick some of it's features to put in your app. Try using the following components:

- Navbar
- Buttons
- Cards
- Forms
- Footer

Installing a theme takes time to iron out all the kinks, and you’ll likely need to work with a TA or an instructor to get everything up and running initially. This can be painful, but once it’s fully installed, it becomes reasonably easy to work with!

#### Deliverable
Update your `movie-vue-app` on github by doing a git add, commit, and push.

Then, go to the `html_themes_solution.md` file in this folder and follow the instructions! Once you've completed the assignment, do this in the independent practice repository:

```bash
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "your commit message goes here"
$ git push origin YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-GOES-HERE
```
